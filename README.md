React-Native-Positron (RNP) is a project that bundles React Native, React-Native-Web, and Electron. It allows you to build cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux, and the webâ€” all from one codebase.

### Build
To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. You will also need to ensure your [React Native development environment](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Freactnative.dev%2Fdocs%2Fenvironment-setup) is set up and that you have a working Android or iOS device or emulator on hand.

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DeveloperBlue/react-native-positron-quickstart.git

# Navigate into the project
cd react-native-positron-quickstart

# Install project dependencies
npm install
```

### Run
In separate terminals, run the following:

```bash
# Start the Metro Bundler
npm start
```
```bash
# Run the webpack development server
npm run run:web
```
```bash
# Deploy the application to an Android device or emulator
npm run run:android

# Deploy the application to an iOS device or emulator
npm run run:ios
```
```bash
# Bundle and launch the Electron application
npm run run:electron
```
## Medium Project Writeup
